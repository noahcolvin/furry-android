## Features

- Dashboard page
- List of store items with filtering
- Item detail page
- Cart page
- Item search

## How to run

- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and open the project.
- Run project on emulator or device.

## Running Tests

- Open the project in Android Studio.
- Right-click on the `androidTest` or `test` folders and select `Run 'All Tests'`.
- This will run the tests on the emulator or device.

## Questions
#### What is the purpose of this project?
I created this project to demonstrate creating a simple mobile app in Android.

I made one in [Flutter](https://github.com/noahcolvin/furry_flutter) and [React Native](https://github.com/noahcolvin/furry-rn) too!

#### Why isn't there much here?
This is just a starting point. I wanted to keep it simple and not include too many features. This is a good starting point for a full application.

#### Where is the backend?
There are a few, currently:

[Supabase/Node](https://github.com/noahcolvin/furry-backend)

[.NET](https://github.com/noahcolvin/furry-backend-dotnet)

[Express/Node](https://github.com/noahcolvin/furry-backend-express)

#### Why is there no authentication?
No need for the current app.

#### Code X is bad, why didn't you do Y?
This is just a sample exercise and was completed in a few days. I'm sure there are many improvements that could be made. Fell free to make an issue or PR if you have a suggestion. This doesn't need to be perfect but I am certainly open to feedback. I may add to it in the future.
